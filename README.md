#Peoplesparql

This is a prototype application as a proof of concept for my larger MSc project.

It requires several packages

flask
rdflib
SPARQLWrapper

(and possibly a few more)

Also the AllegroGraph python client as used here is included as a package inside the peoplesparql main package, see http://franz.com/agraph/support/documentation/v4/python-tutorial/python-API-40.html
